    <h1>Joss Chocolate</h1>
    <p>This conceptual project includes five all original product and packaging designs for a hypothetical chocolate company.</p>
    <p>The company's target audience is teenage boys, for whom I designed very boy-ish chocolates, including bacon-, habanero- and fried onion-infused chocolates as well as a mystery bag which contains all three â€“ but with no labels!</p>
    <p>The packaging includes all mandatory nutrition facts and product labeling per spec on the reverse as well as barcode and company information.</p>
