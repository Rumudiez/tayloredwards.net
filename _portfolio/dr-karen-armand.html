  <p>I helped Dr. Karen Armand transition her professional psychotherapy and yoga therapy services to a more personalized business which would greet clients with more intimacy than her previous web presence.</p>
  <p>For this project I created a visual identity for Dr. Armand including a logo, color scheme, and type treatment which I then brought to form in this website. I was solely responsible for all aspects of this project from concept to implementation.</p>
