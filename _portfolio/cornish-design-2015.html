    <h1>Cornish Design BFA ’15</h1>

    <p>The Cornish Design BFA Expo is the annual student organized show for Cornish's graduating class of design. I worked with two of the other seniors, Patrick Perkins (patterns and typography) and Matthew Verzola (photography), to create the 2015 show's website.</p>
    <p>This website showcases the students before their projects to contrast with other BFA shows in the area and to promote the individuals more prominently. For those more interested in the projects or trying to reverse search for an individual, there is a categorized listing of all projects which aligns with their physical location at Cornish's BFA show.</p>
    <p>On a technical note, the content on this site is managed through a [formerly] shared Google Docs form and spreadsheet. Web pages dynamically pull content from the spreadsheet to display on through the Jekyll-made site hosted freely through Github Pages.</p>
